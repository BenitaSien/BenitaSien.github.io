    <h1>Why Our Forests Are Changing</h1>

    <h2>How They've Changed</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
      
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><p style="text-align: center;">Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines... but what are our forests doing?</p></div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><div id="choropleth_map"></div></div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><p>Many of the countries of the world are experiencing varying levels of de- or re-forestation.
        <br><br>South American rainforests are being torn down for cattle ranches.
      <br><br> Worker exploitation in the cocoa industry is increasing deforestation in West Africa.
      <br><br>Indonesia's forests are cut down to sell wood pulp and palm oil. 
      <br><br>Corruption has given way to illegal logging in Myanmar and Cambodia.
      <br><br>We can see here that deforestation is not just an environmental issue; it's also a socioeconomic one.
      This is evidenced by Cuba and Puerto Rico have been successfully replanting forests due to government initiatives, as well as reductions in 
      plantations and pastures due to socioeconomic transformations. 
      <br><br>Europe and China appear to be reforesting their lands, but we will have to tread carefully when following their lead. 
        For now, let's take a closer look at the effects of agricultural industries on forest cover.
    </p></div>
    </div>
    <h2>The Effects of Agriculture</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><div id="bubble_chart"></div></div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><p>Beef production has the largest impact on forest cover, even compared to other animals like chickens and pigs. 
        Soybeans are also a huge cause of deforestation, as over 66% of soy is produced to feed animals for human consumption.
        Since only 10% of energy is transferred up each link in the food chain, it is apparent that eating the soy directly can reduce amount of 
        produce that must be grown.
      </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-2"><div id="heatmap_chart"></div></div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2"><div id="animal_bubble_chart"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><p>We can see the correlations between meat farmed and the percentage of land covered by forest. The most commonly
        farmed animal for meat appears to be pigs, followed by cattle and chickens.
      </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-5"><p>We can see a large correlation between soy
        and forest cover in countries like Paraguay. </p>
        <p>We can also see how much the soy and palm oil industries have grown since 1990.
      </p></div>
      <div class="pure-u-4-5"><div id="crop_bubble_chart"></div></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <h2>The Effects of Forestry</h2>
        <p>Logging is also a cause of deforestation. Forestry production has been growing over time in many countries. </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-1"><div id="strip_chart"></div></div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1"><p>So we know deforestation is the problem, but what's the solution?
        <br><br> Reforestation and afforestation involve
        planting trees to either rebuild forests or build forests where there were none before. However, care must be taken as forests consist of hundreds or thousands of different species
        of trees. The Great Green Wall afforestation project in China is a case study on the proliferation of disease and pests among monocultures, as well as the
        destruction of pre-existing forests when landowners are paid to plant certain species of trees for profit. It is also imperative when afforesting to preserve
         biomes such as grasslands that are equally as important to their inhabitants as forests are to us.
      </p>

    <p>
      
      However, if done correctly, by allowing many native species to establish themselves, reforestation and afforestation are currently the best options we have to combat the loss of our forests.
